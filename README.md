# Fߔɤkiemiзb Hзa/Viəy (⇧fFYkiemi3b ⇧h3a / ⇧vi2y ,fuduai kie miongbo  honga / alu)
This is a Shidinn Chinese (?) version of Pokémon Red and Blue.
*** This is a untested hack, If you're a noob, Please don't compile!! ***

It builds the following ROMs:

- Pokemon Red (UE) [S][!].gb `sha1: not finished yet`
- Pokemon Blue (UE) [S][!].gb `sha1: not finished yet`
- BLUEMONS.GB (debug build) `sha1: not finished yet`

# The alphabet

To set up the repository, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md).
this hack contains *new* Xdi8Aho alphabet.
If you to use the **lower** one, please using a wide char (`12345678` -> `壹二三四五六柒八`),
The **upper** is just a "汉写" (fEE xo) one, but `17` is still `一七`.
For example:
```
"力ｄｉ八　大ｈｏ"
```
